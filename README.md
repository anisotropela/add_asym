# add_asym

## Description

Python code for adding numbers with asymmetric uncertainties, developed as a part of the work leading to the paper [Chasing Lyman Î±-emitting galaxies at z = 8.8](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07392v1). Basically just a numerical implementation of the statistical methods outlined in [Barlow (2003)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0306138).

## Acknowledgments

If you use the code for scientic use, I'd be happy if you could cite [Laursen et al. (2018), arXiv:1806.07392v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.07392v1), where the code is described, tested, and applied.

## Documentation

I will write a better description here soon, but all you need is the file `add_asym.py`, in which the docstring describes how --- and in particular *why* --- to use the code.
